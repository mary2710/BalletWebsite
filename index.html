Ballet is a traditional style of dance originating in the Italian Renaissance Courts of the 15th and 16th centuries. It later developed into a widespread technical form of dance in France and Russia, with its own French vocabulary, although different styles have emerged from different countries, such as Russian Ballet, English Ballet, French Ballet and Italian Ballet. 
There are many different Ballets that are performed all around the world but there are a few well known ones.

 In a Ballet Company, there are many different roles of dancers, who perform different pieces in a performance. They include:
 <br>
 </p>
 <p>
<ul>

   <li>Principal Dancers</li>
  Principal Dancers are dancers that are experienced members of their company and have worked through all of the ranks below. They are usually the most well known dancers in there company and would perform the main role in a performance, for example Kitri in Don Quixote, Odette/Odile (the White Swan and Black Swan) in Swan Lake or The Sugar Plum Fairy in The Nutcracker. A female dancer can only officially be called a 'ballerina' if she is a Principal. Otherwise she should be called a ballet dancer.

   <li>Soloists</li>
  Soloists are dancers that dance solos in performances, or are often understudies for the principal dancers and will stand in for them when they have to miss a show. 
  
  <br>
  
   <li>Coryphees</li>
  Coryphees are dancers that perform the leading roles in, or are at the front row of, the Corps de Ballet. They will occasionally perform solos in a show, but usually dance as the most experienced members of the Corps de Ballet.
  
  <br>
  
   <li>Corps de Ballet</li>
  The Corps de Ballet is a group of dancers that all dance together in an ensemble. This is usually the lowest rank of dancers in a company and they will perform roles such as The Little Swans in Swan Lake, or they would dance in the Waltz of the Flowers or the Snow scene in the Nutcracker. Most dancers at this rank will stay at this level for their entire career, and only a select few will be promoted to Coryhpee, Soloist or eventually Principal Dancer.
