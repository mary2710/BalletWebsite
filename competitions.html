<p>
After the Semi-Final, all contestants who scored 96 points or above are invited to compete in the Finals which take place in New York City, USA.

In the competition, there are 5 types of dance you can perform.


<ul>

<li>Contemporary Pas de Deux</li>
<li>Ensemble</li>

</ul>

<br>
<p>

It is mandatory for all contestants to perform a classical solo, and there is a list of variations from different ballets that you can choose to perform. In the semi-finals, you don't have to perform a contemporary solo as well, but you must perform one in addition to the classical variation if you make it the the finals.
</p>
<p>
A Pas de Deux is the ballet name for a duet, literally meaning "dance of two". It is not mandatory to perform one of these, and if you choose to do so, it has to be in addition to your clasical solo. If you perform a pas de deux, you have to do a classical one, again there are a list of dances you can perform from different ballets. It is also possible to perform a contemporary pas de deux in addition to your classical pas de deux.
</p>
<p>
An ensemble is a group dance. This can either be classical, contemporary, or somewhere in between.
